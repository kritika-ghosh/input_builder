# GAMESS Input File Builder GUI

A Python-based GUI tool for generating GAMESS input files with customizable parameters and automatic processing of molecular geometry data from XMOL/XYZ files. This project simplifies the creation of input files for computational chemistry simulations.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using the CustomTkinter library, ensuring a clean and modern interface.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows configuration of parameters such as memory allocation, spin, charge, method, runtype, SCFTYP, and basis sets.
- **Geometry File Processing**: Automatically reads and converts XMOL/XYZ file data into the required GAMESS format, including mapping element symbols to atomic numbers.
- **Dynamic Input File Generation**: Produces ready-to-use GAMESS input files based on user-selected options and uploaded geometry data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- The following Python libraries:
  - `customtkinter`
  - `tkinter`

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gamess-input-builder.git
   cd gamess-input-builder
   ```

2. Install the required libraries.

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python gamess_gui.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Configure the desired parameters:
   - Memory allocation
   - Charge and spin
   - Computational method (e.g., B3LYP, MP2, CCSD)
   - RUNTYPE, SCFTYP, and basis set
3. Upload your geometry file (XMOL/XYZ format):
   - The tool will process the file and convert element symbols to atomic numbers.
4. Click on **Generate Input File** to create a GAMESS input file with the specified parameters.
5. The generated file will be saved in the current working directory.

## Output File Example

An example GAMESS input file generated by this tool:

```
$CONTRL SCFTYP=RHF DFTTYP=B3LYP RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE ICHARG=0
COORD=UNIQUE MULT=1 MAXIT=200 ISPHER=1 $END
$SYSTEM MWORDS=50 MEMDDI=30 $END
$STATPT NSTEP=100 HSSEND=.T. $END
$BASIS GBASIS=6-31G* $END
$GUESS GUESS=HUCKEL $END
