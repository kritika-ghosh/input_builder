# GAMESS Input File Builder GUI

A Python-based GUI tool for generating GAMESS input files with customizable parameters and automatic processing of molecular geometry data from XMOL/XYZ files. This project simplifies the creation of input files for computational chemistry simulations.

## Background
This project was designated as a "challenging task" by Dr. Satyam Ravi Shrivastava, our Professor for Computational Chemistry.

## Team Members
- Shivi Sanjay
- Tanisha Panickar
- Adwita Jain
- Kritika Ghosh

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using the CustomTkinter library, ensuring a clean and modern interface.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows configuration of parameters such as memory allocation, spin, charge, method, runtype, SCFTYP, and basis sets.
- **Geometry File Processing**: Automatically reads and converts XMOL/XYZ file data into the required GAMESS format, including mapping element symbols to atomic numbers.
- **Dynamic Input File Generation**: Produces ready-to-use GAMESS input files based on user-selected options and uploaded geometry data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- The following Python libraries:
  - `customtkinter`
  - `tkinter`

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kritika-ghosh/input_builder.git
   cd input_builder
   ```

2. Install the required libraries.

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python input_builder.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Configure the desired parameters:
   - Memory allocation
   - Charge and spin
   - Computational method (e.g., B3LYP, MP2, CCSD)
   - RUNTYPE, SCFTYP, and basis set
3. Upload your geometry file (XMOL/XYZ format):
   - The tool will process the file and convert element symbols to atomic numbers.
4. Click on **Generate Input File** to create a GAMESS input file with the specified parameters.
5. The generated file will be saved in the current working directory.

## Output File Example

An example GAMESS input file generated by this tool:

```
$CONTRL SCFTYP=RHF DFTTYP=B3LYP RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE ICHARG=0
COORD=UNIQUE MULT=1 MAXIT=200 ISPHER=1 $END
$SYSTEM MWORDS=50 MEMDDI=30 $END
$STATPT NSTEP=100 HSSEND=.T. $END
$BASIS GBASIS=6-31G* $END
$GUESS GUESS=HUCKEL $END
$DATA

## Note

Inorder to run the executable file, you might have to temporarily disable the windows security. To do this:
1. go to search
2. go to windows security
3. under "virus and threat protection" click on "manage settings"
4. toggle off "real time threat protection"
5. download the executable file and run it
6. toggle on "real time threat protection"
